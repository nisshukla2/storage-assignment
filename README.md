# storage-assignment

For this following assignment, I learned several new things. First of all, this assignment was a big step up from what we have been doing so far. We have to bring together what we learned from html, css, and javascript to make a functioning website that would take user input and had the functionality to save or clear the username. It's a very simple yet quite useful program. The username can be saved in databases. 

We had to make an html file where we used h1 element to display the header with the text, "Welcome, User". Then we had to create an input box with two buttons that would save the name and clear the name. CSS was used in this program. Hovering functionality was added over the buttons to add more style to the page. For the first time in this class, we had to use DOM manipulation to make the website interactive. We used getElementbyID and addEventListener methods to make it interactive.
